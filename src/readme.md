Power Poles
====================

In this first version are two new power poles. 
- replacements for a huge number of small power poles used to span an area. 
- the first ones spans over 32x32 und the second one spans over 64x64.
- does not change the game balance.
- cost are only slightly higher than if you build the grid one by one: 50 and 170 small power poles and some copper wires. 
- when the grid power pole is deconstructed you get normal small power poles back.
