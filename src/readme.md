Power Poles
====================

In this first version are only 2 but new power poles. Both are replacements for a huge number of small power poles used to span an area. The first ones spans over 32x32 und the second one spans over 64x64. The cost are only slightly higher than if you build the grid one by one: 50 and 170 small power poles and some copper wires. When the grid power pole is deconstructed you get normal small power poles back.

This is my first mod build from scratch so any feedback (English and German) is welcome.
